# purrgatory screensaver
[original project](https://studio.penguinmod.com/#9102327232) made by
[DogeIsCut](https://github.com/DogeisCut)/[uwu](https://penguinmod.com/profile?user=uwu),
screensaver version made by [nataliexists](https://github.com/nataliexists)

this uses [gm82sound](https://github.com/GM82Project/gm82snd/) for its sound system, which means that i have to
state that this uses fmod.

## installation
move "purrgatory.scr" into "C:\Windows", and move "purrgatory.wav" into "C:\Windows" as well.
(i promise this isnt a virus, this is just how screensavers work)

## usage
you can exit the screesaver by pressing any key on your keyboard, but f1 opens up the info panel and escape closes
said panel.
